Group members: **Tuan Linh Tran**, **Andrea Češková**, **Tobias Grüner**

This repository was created to collaborate on the 3rd Assignment in the "Introduction to Geographic Information Systems" at TUD in the summer semester 2025. We will be analysing the following:

-   Geographic area: Netherlands

-   Research question: **How does the relationship between population density and temperature vary across different land use types around Netherlands?**

-   Data sources:

    -   [Administrative boundaries](https://gadm.org/)

    -   [Temperature data](https://chelsa-climate.org/)

    -   [Land use](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/corine-land-cover)

    -   [Population density](https://www.worldpop.org/)
