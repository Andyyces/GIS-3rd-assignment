## Tasks (According to Assignment Paper)

**Bold** are Notes from us

### Step 1 - Choose a geographic area and find geo-data
- ~~You can use as many datasets (also not geo-data) as you wish, but the project should
include at least one raster dataset and a shapefile dataset.~~

- Try to download them and understand they are available in a format that you are able to
work with.
- ~~At this point, you email me your group and your datasets of choice, this should
happen by Monday, June 2nd.~~

**Notes:**

 - Administrative boundaries: vector from GADM
 - Temperature: raster from CHELSA
 - Land use: Rater/Vector from Corine or geodata package
 - Population density: raster from HDX


### Step 2 - Choose an analysis framework
- ~~Use something simple (i.e., count the presence of a phenomenon in one area against another
at two points in time and compare them, or correlations).~~
- Choose something that you feel confident in and that you think you can interpret the
results of.
- ~~Think of how you can use your data at best for this analysis.~~

### Step 3 - Wrangle the data and produce a nice descriptive statistics table/figure
- Clean your data for your analysis framework
- Write down the data description and produce on table/figure to describe the data
### Step 4 - Run the analysis and discuss the results
- Run the analysis and report the results
- Write down a results comment, remember to try to answer your declared initial question.
### Step 5 - Make sure at some point you produced a nice map
- Make sure you use the things we learnt in the exercise classes and produce a nice map
that either shows your data or your results.
### Step 6 - Make the final .pdf/.html knitted file
- Hide the part of the code in your document and make sure it looks like a nice self-contained
report.
- Finally, make sure your code runs through the machine of both you and your groupmates
and submit the assignment by Monday, 7th of July, 9 am.
- Project submission format: Ideally, you are giving me the link to a GitHub folder that
contains a README file where your group has written down an explanation of how to run
the files in the GitHub folder to produce the .html or .pdf submission, which is already
included in the folder. It is also ok to upload a zipped folder on OPAL or to email me
the link to a Drive folder (if you do this, please make sure to share with me the link with
permission to open the files in the folder).
